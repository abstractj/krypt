== krypt

The goal of krypt is to provide a platform- and
library-independent cryptography API for all C(++)-based Ruby
implementations and JRuby.

Its major part is implemented in Ruby, and it additionally offers
the possibility to integrate OS- or language-specific native
libraries to implement cryptographic primitives. krypt aims at
offering performance while still improving the security and
features of the Ruby cryptography infrastructure. Its motto is to
keep all the good parts of what exists today and to improve the parts
that need improvement. It offers an idiomatic, modern API that
cherry-picks the best features of other popular libraries and also
offers new features that are not offered by others today.
